# Welcome

Text Memorizer is an **offline-first** flashcard app for memorizing facts, passages, and Q&A pairs using spaced repetition.

- Everything lives in **your browser** (IndexedDB). No account, no server.
- The app works **offline** once loaded — install it as a PWA for the smoothest experience.
- Because your data is local, **back up often**. See *Backup & sync* below.

If this is your first visit, start with the *Quick tour* and *Your first card* topics.

# Quick tour

The top nav has four tabs:

- **Library** — your decks and cards. Create, edit, search, and start reviews here.
- **Stats** — streaks, mastery distribution, due forecast, ratings breakdown.
- **Import** — bring in markdown decks, plain text, JSON, or restore a snapshot backup.
- **Backup** — export a snapshot, connect a sync folder, or jump to restore.

The Library header also has **Settings** (theme, daily limits, encryption) and **Help** (this screen).

During a review, keyboard shortcuts speed things up — see *Keyboard shortcuts*.

1. From the **Library**, click **+ Card**.
2. Choose a **card type** (Standard is a good start).
3. Give it a **title**, pick or create a **deck**, optionally add **tags** (comma-separated).
4. Fill in the card sides. Markdown and \`$math$\` work.
5. Click **Save Card**.

Once a deck has cards, click **Review** on the deck row in the Library to start a session.

# Standard flashcard

The classic front/back card, but with **2+ sides**. Use it for vocabulary, definitions, formulas, Q&A.

- Each side accepts **markdown** and \`$math$\` ([more on syntax](#topic-markdown-and-math)).
- Press **+ Image** to attach an image (or paste/drag an image right into the textarea — it's stored as base64 inside the card).
- Press **+ Audio** to attach an audio file, or **Record** to record one in-app ([details](#topic-card-audio)).
- Use ↑ / ↓ to reorder sides, **Remove** to delete one.
- Tick **Also create reverse companion** to auto-create a mirrored card ([details](#topic-card-reverse)).

During review, you see side 1, then reveal subsequent sides one by one, then rate the whole card.

# Text memorization

Paste a passage you want to memorize word-for-word — a poem, a definition, a speech opening — and the app reveals it progressively.

**Blinding modes** during review:
- **Easy** — full text shown; warmup.
- **Letter hint** — first letter visible, rest hidden.
- **Blind** — words hidden entirely.

The app picks a default mode based on each word's mastery. Before rating, you can adjust:
- **K** keep • **E** easier • **H** harder • **C** cycle blinding mode

The app tracks mastery **per word**, so the words you stumble on are blinded more aggressively next time. See [Adaptive blinding](#topic-adaptive-blinding-deep) for the full mechanics.

Anki-style fill-in-the-blank cards. Write a passage and wrap the bits you want to hide:

The capital of {{c1::France}} is {{c2::Paris::city}}.
\`\`\`

- \`{{c1::answer}}\` — a basic cloze.
- \`{{c1::answer::hint}}\` — same, with a hint shown in the blank.
- Multiple groups (\`c1\`, \`c2\`, …) become **independent review entries** — each has its own schedule and mastery.
- Reuse a group name (e.g. \`c1\` twice) to hide multiple spans together.

The editor shows a live preview of detected groups and the fully-revealed back text. The card's overall mastery is the average across its groups.

- Companion: *Side 2 → Side 1*

The companion is independently scheduled (they're separate cards) but the link is tracked. If you edit the companion's source card, the editor shows a hint and won't let you create a duplicate. Deleting the source can also clean up the companion.

- Images (\`![alt](url)\`) — incl. base64 \`data:\` URIs.
- Audio via \`<audio>\` tags (auto-inserted by + Audio / Record).
- Math: \`$inline$\` and \`$$display$$\` with KaTeX. Example: $E = mc^2$.

You can disable math rendering in *Settings* if you want \`$...$\` to render literally.

HTML is sanitized — \`<script>\` and other dangerous tags are stripped, so pasting in untrusted markdown is safe.

A session is built from three buckets, in order:

1. **Due** cards — past their \`nextDueAt\` timestamp.
2. **Failed-recently** cards — flagged after an *Again* rating, even if their next due date is in the future.
3. **New** cards — never reviewed; capped at *New cards per session* (Settings).

The total is capped at *Daily review limit* (Settings, default 30). The header shows how many you've already reviewed in this session.

**End session** prompts a confirm if there are cards left. Otherwise the session closes silently and you return to the Library.

Failed cards loop back into the queue within the same session, so you'll see them again before you're done.

# Ratings

After you reveal a card, pick the rating that matches your recall:

| Rating | Meaning | Effect on schedule |
|---|---|---|
| **Again** | Failed — couldn't recall | Interval drops to ~6 hours, ease decreases |
| **Hard** | Recalled but with effort | Interval grows slowly (× 1.2) |
| **Good** | Recalled comfortably | Interval × current ease (~2.5×) |
| **Easy** | Recalled with no hesitation | Interval × ease × 1.4, ease bumps up |
| **Perfect** | Knew it cold, no thought | Interval × ease × 1.8, ease bumps up more |

There's no "right" rating — be honest. The system tunes intervals around how *you* rate, so consistent self-grading matters more than picking the "best" word.

For *Text memorization* cards, the app tracks mastery **per word**. The next time you see the card:

- Well-mastered words get **lighter hints** (or stay visible).
- Words you missed get **stronger blinding** (full hide, letter-only hints).

The K / E / H / C controls let you override the suggestion *before* you rate the card. The rating updates per-word stats — words you stumbled over during recall get a mastery hit.

Supported:
- \`.md\` — markdown deck format ([details](#topic-md-deck-format)).
- \`.txt\` — single plain-text card (text memorization).
- \`.json\` — structured card array (use the export format as a reference).

Markdown imports always start as **new cards** with fresh schedules. If you want to migrate cards between devices with mastery intact, use a **snapshot** instead (Backup → Export Snapshot).

Cards with the same fingerprint as existing cards are **skipped** as duplicates — you'll see the count in the import preview.

\`\`\`

Rules:

**Backup → Export Snapshot** produces a JSON file containing all your cards, decks, reviews, sessions, settings, and (if enabled) encryption metadata.

- On desktop, the file downloads to your downloads folder.
- On mobile, the Web Share API lets you save it to iCloud Drive, Google Drive, Files, etc.

**Restore** (Import → Restore from Snapshot) is **replace-all**:
1. The app first **downloads your current data** as an "emergency" backup — automatic safety net.
2. Then it wipes IndexedDB and replays the snapshot.

⚠️ Snapshot files are **not encrypted** even if your vault is. Anyone who opens the file can read all your cards. Treat snapshots like personal data.

There's no merge mode yet. To move data between two active devices without losing progress, **pick one** as canonical and replace from there.

# Sync folder

**Chromium-only feature** (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave). On Firefox and Safari this section is hidden.

**Backup → Connect Sync Folder** asks you to pick a folder on disk. Once connected:

- Every snapshot you export is **also written to that folder** automatically. File names include a timestamp.
- The **Import** screen lists snapshots in that folder for one-tap restore.
- The connection persists across reloads. If permission was revoked (e.g., after a browser restart), the next export prompts to re-authorize.

Common pairings:
- Point both devices at the same iCloud / Google Drive / Dropbox folder. Export on device A → device B sees the snapshot in *Import → From Sync Folder*.

The app never reads or writes the folder without an explicit user action (export, list, restore).

Optional **at-rest encryption** for your card data.

**What's encrypted**
- Card content (sides, text-memory text, cloze text), title, tags.
- Deck names.

**What's NOT encrypted**
- Review history, ratings, schedule timestamps.
- Stats (counts, durations, streaks).
- Snapshots — the export is plain JSON. Don't share it.

**Setup**
1. Settings → **Enable Encryption**.
2. Pick a password. The key is derived locally; the password itself is never stored.
3. Existing cards and deck names are encrypted in place.

**Each app launch** asks for the password to unlock the vault. If you cancel, the app stays locked — cards aren't visible until you reload and unlock.

**Change Password** decrypts everything, derives a new key, re-encrypts. **Disable Encryption** decrypts everything back to plain.

There's **no recovery** if you forget the password. Keep an unencrypted snapshot somewhere safe as a fallback.

# How spaced repetition works

The scheduler is an SM-2 variant. Each card carries two key numbers:

- **interval** — days until next review.
- **ease** — multiplier (starts at **2.5**, floor **1.3**).

On each rating, both update:

| Rating | New interval | Ease change |
|---|---|---|
| **Again** | \`0.25\` days (≈ 6h) | − 0.3 |
| **Hard** | \`interval × 1.2\` (min 1) | − 0.15 |
| **Good** | \`interval × ease\` (min 1) | unchanged |
| **Easy** | \`interval × ease × 1.4\` (min 3) | + 0.1 |
| **Perfect** | \`interval × ease × 1.8\` (min 7) | + 0.15 |

\`nextDueAt = now + interval days\`. Ease is clamped to a 1.3 floor so badly-rated cards never grow uncatchably fast.

**Queue priority** combines: is-due, days overdue, never-reviewed bonus, recently-failed bonus, and \`(1 − mastery) × 20\` so weaker cards float up.

# Adaptive blinding internals

For text-memory cards the passage is tokenized into words + separators. Each **word token** carries its own mini-stats: \`seenCount\`, \`correctCount\`, \`mastery\` (0..1).

**During recall**, the app picks a blinding mode per word:
- High mastery → visible or first-letter hint.
- Low mastery → fully blinded.

You can override the choice (**K** keep, **E** easier, **H** harder, **C** cycle) before rating.

**On rating**, per-word mastery shifts based on which words were revealed/missed and the overall rating. Whole-card mastery is the **average across all word tokens**.

Punctuation, whitespace, and short stop-tokens never get blinded — they're skipped by the tokenizer's "blindable?" check.

Each \`{{cN::…}}\` group is parsed into a unique key (\`c1\`, \`c2\`, …). The card stores:

- A \`groupStats\` map: \`{ c1: { ease, interval, mastery, … }, c2: { … } }\`.
- An **aggregate** \`cardStats\` on the card itself, refreshed after edits.

When you review a cloze card, the scheduler **rates a single group at a time**. The other groups are unaffected. The card's aggregate mastery is the average across all groups — so a card with one weak group still surfaces in due/failed queues.

Editing the source text:
- Unchanged group keys keep their stats.
- New keys start fresh.
